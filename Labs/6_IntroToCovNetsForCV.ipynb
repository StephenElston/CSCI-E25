    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces you to a powerful neural network architecture, known as **convolutional neural networks**. Convolutional neural networks operate by **learning a set of filters**  or **convolution kernels**. Using a process, known as **convolution**, these filters extract a **feature map** from the raw data. The feature map is a **lower dimensional** map of the raw input features. This map is learned in a supervised machine learning process employing back propagation. You can think of convolutional neural networks as a powerful and flexible **dimensionality reduction** method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks are used to build feature maps from any type of data with coherency in one or more dimensions. This includes time series data, and text data as one dimensional cases, and image data as a two dimensional case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks have a resonably long history. The first known commerical application was for automated processing of check images by LeCun et. al. (1998). For unclear reasons, convolutional neural networks were religated to specialized applications such as hand writing recognition until Krizhevsky et. al. (2012) used them to deciscively win an ImageNet object recognition competition. Curiously, other teams had previously used convolutional neural networks to win competitons, but somehow this was not widely recognized. \n",

    "The solution is to use a variable learning rate. The variable learning rate decreases at the training proceeds. In this way, the learning rate can be optimized to ensure the fastest posslble convergence of the learning. The variable learning rate is determined by a schedule. Common schedules include lenear decreases and exponential decreases. Keras supports a number of [learning rate schedulers](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/learning_rate_schedules/).      "

    "> **Exercise 6-8:** You will now investigate using a variable learning rate for training the CNN model. The code in the cell bellow does the following:  \n",
    "> 1. An exponentially decay learning rate schedule is created using [tensorflow.keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/learning_rate_schedules/exponential_decay/). \n",
    "> 2. The `nnv` model is instantiated, using the function you created earlier, and compiled. A learning rate schedule can be incorporated into most Keras optimizers. In this case, the [RMSprop optimizer](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/experimental/RMSprop) has an `learning_rate` argument set to the learning rate just created, and with `decay=0.001`.    \n",

    "\n",
    "> **Note:** You may be wondering why a new model needs to be instantiated to run this experiement. The reason is that Keras (nd Tensorflow) model objects will retain any weight values from previous learning. This property can be an advantage if one wishes to do additional training. For example, additional training can be performed when additional data is avaialable, without starting over again. Hoeever, if one wishes to run an independent experiment, as we do here, it is best to instantiate a new model object.    "
