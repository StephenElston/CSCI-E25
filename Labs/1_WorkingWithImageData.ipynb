This package provides many commonly used computer vision algorithms using a consistent Python API. This package follows the API conventions of Scikit-Learn, enabling the application of a rich library of machine learning algorithms. There is excellent documentation available for the [Scikit-Learn Image package](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/index.html). You may wish to start by reading through the [User Guide](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/user_guide/index.html). Examples of what you can do with Scikit-Learn Image package can be seen in the [Gallery](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/index.html).    \n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Scikit-Image and Numpy:** Like all Scikit packages Scikit-Image is built on [Numpy](https://numpy.org/). If you are not very familiar with Numpy there is an ReviewOfLinearAlgebra Jupyter notebook under the SuplementaryMaterial directory in the course GitHub repository, or you can find Tutorials [here](https://numpy.org/numpy-tutorials/). A tutorial on using Numpy with Scikit-learn image data objects can be found [here](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/user_guide/numpy_images.html)."
