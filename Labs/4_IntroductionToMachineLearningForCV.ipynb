    "The concept of the linear model is the basis of many statistical and machine learning models. Further, an understanding of linear models is a good basis for understand many other types of statistical and machine learning models.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will focus on linear classification models, but the lessons drawn from this discussion can be applied to many other types of ML models. By developing an understanding of linear models, you are building a foundation to understand many other machine learning models. Nearly all machine learning methods suffer from the same problems, including over-fitting and mathematically unstable fitting methods. Understanding these problems in the linear regression context will help you work with other machine learning models.     \n",

    "The method of regression is one of the oldest and most widely used analytics methods. The goal of regression is to produce a model that represents the **best fit** to some observed data. Typically the model is a function describing some type of curve (lines, parabolas, etc.) that is determined by a set of parameters (e.g., slope and intercept). *Best fit* means that there is an optimal set of parameters which minimize an error criteria we choose.     \n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning models, including some of the latest deep learning methods, are a form of regression. **Linear regression** is the foundational form of regression. Linear regression minimizes squared error of the predictions of the dependent variable using the values of the independent variables. This approach is know as the **method of least squares**.   \n",

    "Linear classifiers are an extension of linear regression. The linear output is transformed to a categorical probability distribution. The category with the highest probability is typically selected as the final result.  "
