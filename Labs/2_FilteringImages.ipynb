    "## Power Spectrum of Images\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful way to understand the effect of a filter on the image is to examine the power spectrum of the image. This is done by decomposing the image into its sinusodial components of different frequencies. This decomponsition is know as a [**Fourier transform**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform). We will not purse any detail in this discussion, going only far enough to gain a basic ability to interpret the results.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To compute a Fourier transform on a discretely sampled data, such as digital image data, the [**discrete Fourier transform (DFT)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform). For a one dimensional sequential sample, $\\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_n]$, we can decompose this sequence into a sequence of complex frequency components, $\\mathbf{\\Omega} = [\\omega_0, \\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\ldots, \\omega_{N-1}]$. The basic DFT for one frequency component, $X_k$, is formulated as:        \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Omega_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \\cdot e^{-\\frac{i2\\pi}{N}kn}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we understand this difficult relationship. First, recall that the $i$ symbol indicates a complex number. Next, it is useful to note that we can represent a complex exponential function into sin and cos function using [**Euler's formula**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e^{-i\\ q} = cos(q) - i\\ sin(q)\\\\   \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying Euler's formula to the DFT, we get the following relation:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Omega_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n cos \\Bigg(\\frac{2 \\pi}{N}kn \\Bigg) - i\\ x_n\\ sin \\Bigg( \\frac{2 \\pi}{N}kn \\Bigg)\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "From the above relationships one can see that the DFT is a linear superposition of the complex sinusiods with the sequence $\\mathbf{x}$. Each component, $X_k$, represents the a coefficeint for a specific frequency and phase. Another way to understand the DFT is as a convolution between the sinusods of different frequencies and phases and the sequence, $\\mathbf{x}$. Phase is represented by the complex value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes here, we are not interested in the complex representation. Rather, we are interested in the **power spectrum**. The power spectrum is the square of the magnitude of the spectral components. The power spectrum is symmetric about zero. Each frequncy component is represented on both the positive side and the negative side.   \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we focued on one-dimensional sequences, $\\mathbf{x}$. Of course, images are multi-dimensional. While we will not go into detials, one can easily extend the DFT to multiple dimensions.       "

    "> **Exercise 2-8:** You will now explore how changing the median filter span effects the image. To see this effect, start with the gray-scale cat image with added Gaussian noise and then plot the median filtered image in 4 rows of a plot array using values of  span $= [3, 5, 7, 9]$. Make sure the titles of the images indicate the span value. In the second column of each row display the 2-dimensional FFT of the filtered image.   "

The *f*image pyramid** is just such a technique.    \n",

The pyramid is a data structure is therefore an convenient method to represent multiple scales of an image.    \n",
