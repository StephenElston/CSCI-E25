    "### Transfer learning   \n",
    "Transfer learning employs deep neural network models which have been previously trained on large datasets. This pre-training can require enormous computing resources, and management of massive datasets. These resources are often not available in practice. The dataset available for a particular problem may be too small, or the computing resources may not be available for the project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most deep learning platforms have a module of pre-trained models. You can find an [extensive lists of pre-trained models for Keras](https://keras.io/api/applications/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can use a model with weights trained previously on other datasets. We stay that we **transfer** the learning from one task **learned** with some training data to another task with different image characteristics. This process is known as **transfer learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases of transfer learning there are two major components of the model, a **backbone network** and a **head**. The pre-trained **backbone** network produces a feature map. A head, placed on the backbone, performs the task-specific learning. Examples of task-specific learning include:   \n",
    "- **Object classification:** Our goal for the exercises in this lesson.  \n",
    "- **Object detection:** Fine the objects in an image.  \n",
    "- **Semantic segmentation:** Detect and label the types of 'things' in an image.  \n",
    "- **Object tracking:** Track how the objects in an series of images (a video) are moving.   \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches to task-specific training with transfer learning:     \n",
    "\n",
    "**Frozen backbone network:** The weights of the backbone network are frozen and the resulting feature map is used directly. The weights of the task-specific head are learned using task-specific data. This approach minimizes the volume of task-specific data required, since only the weights of the head need be trained. This approach leads to methods known as **few shot training** for a specific case of a task. Accuracy may be sacrificed since the feature map is not optimized for the task.         \n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine tune training of the backbone network:** Weights of the task specific head are learned using the task-specific data. At the same time, the weights of the backbone network are **fine-tuned** for the task. In many cases, only a few epochs are required for fine tuning. This approach often provides better performance, since the feature map produced by the backbone has the chance to learn task-specific features. However, fine tuning of the backbone network may fail if there is insufficient data to effectively train the large number of additional weights.     \n"

    "### Data augmentation     \n",
    "\n",
    "Even with good pre-training, sufficient task-specific data may not be available even to learn the required head weights using transfer learning. In such cases one can apply **data augmentation**.  The process of data augmentation creating new training samples from existing training images. The new image samples are created by **randomly** applying one or more **transformations** to the original image. The label of the transformed image is the same as the original image. Yet, given the randomly chosen transformations applied, the new image will have different characteristics. Further, since the transformations are random in nature, several new samples can be created from the same original image. Thus, augmented data will help training models for better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning platforms include packages for standard random data augmentation. For example, in the Keras documentation you can find [examples of applying random transformations](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/data_augmentation) to augment image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of random transformations which can be used to augment image training data include:   \n",
    "1. Random rotation.     \n",
    "2. Random translation along either or both axes.  \n",
    "3. Random cropping of the image followed by resizing to the original size.\n",
    "4. Flipping the transformed image to create a mirror image.   \n",
    "5. Randomly adjusting the contrast of the image.   \n",
    "6. Adding Gaussian or other noise to the image.  \n",
    "7. Independently applying random brightness adjustments to the histograms of the color channels.\n",

    "\n",
    "EfficientNet, first introduced in [Tan and Le, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946)\n",

    "reached near-SOTA level performance with a significantly smaller model. By introducing a heuristic for\n",
    "scaling the model, EfficientNet provides a family of models (B0 to B7) that represents a\n",
    "good combination of efficiency and accuracy on a variety of scales. The compound-scaling\n",
    "heuristics (for details see\n",
    "[Tan and Le, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946)) allows the\n",
    "efficiency-oriented base model (B0) to surpass models at every scale, while avoiding\n",

    "### B0 to B7 variants of EfficientNet\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the [original EfficientNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) people may have the\n",
    "impression that the model comprises a continuous family created by arbitrarily\n",
    "choosing scaling factors.  However, choice of resolution,\n",
    "depth and width are also restricted by multiple factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resolution:** Resolutions not divisible by 8, 16, etc. cause zero-padding near boundaries\n",
    "of some layers, wasting computational resources. This constrain applies particularly to smaller\n",
    "variants of the model, hence the input resolution for B0 and B1 are chosen as 224 and\n",
    "240.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Depth and width:** The building blocks of EfficientNet demands channel size to be\n",
    "multiples of 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource limit:** Memory limitation can limit resolution when depth\n",
    "and width are increased. Increasing depth and/or\n",
    "width while maintaining resolution can still improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the depth, width and resolution of each variant of the EfficientNet models\n",
    "are chosen to produce good results, even if these choices deviate from the compound scaling formula.\n",
    "As a result, the Keras implementation only provides 8 models, B0 to B7,\n",

    "\n",
    "Keras models maintains weight values from one training to the next. As a final step in model training, we will attempt fine-tuning of the weights of the entire model. Freezing/unfreezing models by setting `trainable` for a model allows all layers of the model to be trainable so updates to the weights can be learned.  The point of fine tuning is increase model performance by performing an incremental task-specific training of the the model weights. Using task-specific data for this training step allows the backbone to learn some task-specific features, different from the ones learned from ImageNet data alone. Since there are a large number of weights and only limited training data, only a small improvement is expect from this refinement.      \n",
