    "### Overview of Conventional Object Detection Algorithms    \n",
    "\n",
    "The object recognition problem has been around for quite some time. Historically, object recognition was performed using hand engineered features. By 2012 the **mean average precision** or **mAP** of object recognition had stagnated at around 40%. Only since 2013 there has been a surge of both interest and performance of object recognition with the introduction of deep learning methods. Since that time, the mAP achieved has continued to increase and is now routinely over 80%.  These algorithms no longer require the cumbersome process of hand engineering features. Some key papers in the history of deep object recognition are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In 2013 [Erhan et. al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.2249.pdf) published Scalable Object Detection using Deep Neural Networks, which introduced the R-CNN algorithm the first widely accepted deep learning object detection algorithm. R-CNN demonstrated a significant improvement in object recognition accuracy. However, this algorithm proved to be too slow for real-time video processing. \n",
    "2. The Fast R-CNN algorithm was introduced by [Girshick](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.08083.pdf) Fast R-CNN simplified the required computations but still struggled with real-time video.  \n",
    "3. Further improvements by [Ren et. al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf) lead to the Faster R-CNN algorithm. However, the computational complexity of this algorithm was still rather high.  \n",
    "4. The Mask R-CNN algorithm was proposed by [He, et. al. in 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06870.pdf) The Mask R-CNN algorithm exhibits significantly improved object detection accuracy. This is particularly the case where there are large numbers of objects, such as flock of birds or a crowd of people. While not efficient enough for real-time video, Mask R-CNN should be considered if accuracy in complex scenes is required. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these algorithms share a similar architecture. This architecture is in the form of a pipeline with process steps computed sequentially. The key steps in these pipelines generally include: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convolutional Neural Network:** The CNN creates features which which are used to detect and then classify objects in the image.   \n",
    "2. **Candidate bounding boxes:** Candidate bounding boxes are generated. Multiple candidate bounding boxes cover each region. \n",
    "3. **Filtering of bounding boxes:** The probability of an object being in each bounding box is computed and low probability boxes are filtered. \n",
    "4. **Minimal bounding boxes:** The size of the bounding boxes must be adjusted to best fit the objects detected. \n",
    "5. **Classification:** The objects in the bounding box are classified. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that training and performing inference with these complex pipelines has significant computational complexity. Further, these pipelines can be difficult to train."
