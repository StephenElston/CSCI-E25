    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces you to a powerful neural network architecture, known as **convolutional neural networks**. Convolutional neural networks operate by **learning a set of filters**  or **convolution kernels**. Using a process, known as **convolution**, these filters extract a **feature map** from the raw data. The feature map is a **lower dimensional** map of the raw input features. This map is learned in a supervised machine learning process employing back propagation. You can think of convolutional neural networks as a powerful and flexible **dimensionality reduction** method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks are used to build feature maps from any type of data with coherency in one or more dimensions. This includes time series data, and text data as one dimensional cases, and image data as a two dimensional case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks have a resonably long history. The first known commerical application was for automated processing of check images by LeCun et. al. (1998). For unclear reasons, convolutional neural networks were religated to specialized applications such as hand writing recognition until Krizhevsky et. al. (2012) used them to deciscively win an ImageNet object recognition competition. Curiously, other teams had previously used convolutional neural networks to win competitons, but somehow this was not widely recognized. \n",

The coverage of the convolution opertor can be expanded by **zero padding** in the spatial dimenstion. With the zero padding added, the convolution operator covers the entire spatial dimension of the input tensor. This type of convolution is sometime referred to as **same convolution**, since the output tensor has the same spatial dimensions. \n",
